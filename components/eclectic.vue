            David Buck and his daughter, Heather Indest, purchased the old Domingue’s Motors building, a structure that had
            remained abandoned for decades, with the vision of restoring it as a multi-use restaurant, shopping, and event
            space. Partnering with their good friends, Johnny & Coatney Raymond, they created Buck & Johnny’s. With a unique
            Cajun twist on Italian standards and their own award-winning Cajun dishes, Buck & Johnny’s serves up authentic
            Cajun-Italian fusion using locally-sourced ingredients. The ambiance of the old Domingue’s Motors has been
            maintained in the décor, featuring old tin signage and oil can light fixtures. The former parts window now
            serves as our server window, bridging the gap between our fantastic chef and you. The restaurant features a
            two-sided balcony, overhanging both the dining side and our renowned Filling Station bar. Top notch bourbons and
            wines, warm and caring staff, and live music nightly make it the perfect spot for a family outing, special
            occasion, or a romantic dinner for two.
